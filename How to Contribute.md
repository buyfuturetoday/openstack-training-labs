Testing
-------


1. Test Scripts Individually.
  Run the Scripts inside the Scripts Folder to check whether the shell scripts are properly functioning.
  You Dont Need to install Vitual Box although it is adviced to do so, as there is a good chance that you may end up breaking your host machine.
  
  * How to Test them??
    
    Testing these scripts is as simple as running them. Although some of the scripts need the required Input parameters.
    
  **Note:** No Need for Virutlabox Guest Addons for testing these scripts.

2. Test Entire System
